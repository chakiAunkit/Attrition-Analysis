## Attrition Analysis for Deloitte Employees

### Introduction

This project aims to analyze employee attrition data from Deloitte to identify factors that contribute to employee turnover. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build predictive models that can be used to identify at-risk employees and develop targeted interventions to reduce attrition.

### Data

The dataset used in this project consists of employee data from Deloitte, including information on employee demographics, job characteristics, and performance metrics. The dataset also includes a label indicating whether or not an employee has left the company.

### Methodology

The project employs a variety of machine learning techniques to analyze the employee data and build predictive models. These techniques include:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA is used to understand the distribution of variables in the dataset and identify any patterns or relationships between variables.

* **Feature Engineering:** Feature engineering is used to create new features from existing data that may be more relevant for predicting attrition.

* **Model Selection and Training:** Various machine learning algorithms are trained on the data to identify the algorithm that performs best at predicting attrition.

* **Model Evaluation:** The performance of the selected model is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Results

The project findings indicate that several factors contribute to employee attrition, including:

* **Employee demographics:** Younger employees, male employees, and employees with higher education levels are more likely to leave the company.

* **Job characteristics:** Employees in certain job roles, such as consulting and technology, are more likely to leave the company.

* **Performance metrics:** Employees with lower performance ratings are more likely to leave the company.

### Conclusions

The results of this project can be used to develop targeted interventions to reduce attrition. For example, the company could offer career development programs for younger employees, provide mentorship opportunities for female employees, and implement performance improvement plans for employees with lower performance ratings.

### Future Work

Future work on this project could include:

* **Collecting additional data:** Collecting additional data on employee satisfaction, work-life balance, and other factors that may contribute to attrition could improve the accuracy of predictive models.

* **Developing more complex models:** Developing more complex machine learning models, such as deep learning models, could further improve the accuracy of predictive models.

* **Deploying predictive models in production:** Deploying predictive models in production could enable the company to identify at-risk employees in real time and take proactive measures to prevent them from leaving.
